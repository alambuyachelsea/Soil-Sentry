# Soil Sentry

By Alambuya Chelsea CA223SF

## Project Overview
The soil sentry is a small scale irrigation system which allows a user to connect multiple plants with various water consumption needs, monitor their water levels and supply water them when needed in addition to monitoring the water reservoir levels. 

### - Is the amount of time for the project estimated??? meaning what

## Project Objective
Many at home watering solutins exist but are limited to just soil moisture levels and water supply. These solutions are sufficient for plants that have the same water consumption needs but to an owner of various plant types like succulents, herbs and flowering plants this can lead to over or under watering plants by trying to calibrate a single water supply to them.
With the soil sentry, a user can create differnt plant profiles where each plant's water consumption needs will determine how offen it recieves water from the supply. Additionally, the water reservoir is monitored which allows the user to know when re-fill it.
By monitoring the data, users can have a better idea of their plant needs, reduce water waste by ensuring the plants are only watered when they need it.

## IDE
I developed this on a computer running windows 11. I decided to use Thonny because it is specifically designed for beginners in Python programming, offering an intuitive interface, easy debugging tools, and seamless integration with MicroPython for microcontroller projects. Installation instruction can be found on the [Thonny website](https://thonny.org/)
